            Did you know?

Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system.
It's the only known celestial body to support life as we know it.
Approximately 71% of its surface is covered in water, earning it the nickname "the Blue Planet."
Fun Facts:

Earth's diameter is about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles).
It takes about 365.25 days for Earth to orbit the Sun, giving us our calendar year.
Our planet is home to a diverse range of ecosystems and over 7 billion humans.
Let's cherish and protect this beautiful world we call home! ðŸŒŽðŸ’š
